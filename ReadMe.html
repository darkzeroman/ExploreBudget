	<u><strong>Info</strong></u><br />
	Explore the 2010 US budget. To move the pie chart use the mouse to drag the chart and/or use the mouse wheel to scroll through the chart. Click for zoom levels using the buttons.</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>Motivation</strong></u><br />
	I wanted to make a pie chart to explore the US 2010 budget.&nbsp; Realizing that the budget has many large and small parts which would be hard to show properly, it was required to look at one part of the pie at a time, so I made this rotating pie chart.</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>Tools</u></strong><br />
	Protovis, jQuery, FancyBox</p>
<p>
	<strong><u>Results</u></strong><br />
	I&#39;ll be first to admit that this didn&#39;t turn out how I wanted it to. The text is too small, but it&#39;s hard to look at this properly at the smallest levels. Maybe it would be easier to remove the largest parts (National Security and Social Security) since those don&#39;t have interesting subsections.<br /><br />
	I would like to add proper colors which match for the first level and second level nodes.</p>
